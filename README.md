# OutRun-1986

---

## Game Info 

Tribute to the 1986 old school arcade game OutRun done in the last three months. The first stage has been replicated with the help of the SDL libraries. The code has been coded in C++ and follows a simple modular structure. 

Even though only the first stage has been reproduced, the code is prepared to introduce further stages. All the code necessary to introduce new visual elements or different roads is already implemented, as well as the classic Outrun intersection of the roads between stages. 

Some logic and functions would obviously need to be added, but even though I knew that the full replica would be impossible to achieve, the code has been structured to favor expansion and be able to add new stages and mechanics that existed in the original game without too many changes.

## Victory conditions

There is a time limit to reach the goal, if you fail to reach a certain point on the stage before the time runs out you lose.

## Game Tips

Each lane has a different speed, so make sure to know which are fast lanes and which are slow lanes. Driving in fast lanes is easier as the cars will not approach you as fast, so you will have more time to react.

Also the cars start always on the same position and have the same speed each game, so you can learn their patterns in order to know when to steer.

Additionally, the game difficulty is relatively high, as with only one stage once you pass it you finish the game. To win, you cannot crash into any car, as the time you lose is almost always too much to finish in time.
